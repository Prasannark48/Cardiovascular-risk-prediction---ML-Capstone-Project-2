# Cardiovascular-risk-prediction---ML-Capstone-Project-2

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term for conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels. It's usually associated with a build-up of fatty deposits inside the arteries (atherosclerosis) and an increased risk of blood clots. There are many different types of CVD. one of the main type is Coronary heart disease(CHD). Coronary heart disease occurs when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle is blocked or reduced.

Cardiovascular disease includes heart or blood vessel issues, including:

1.Narrowing of the blood vessels in your heart, other organs or throughout your body.

2.Heart and blood vessel problems present at birth.

3.Irregular heart rhythms.

The given dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Variables Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.

First, I performed data cleaning for the raw data. Asking right question to dataset is always considered as great approach so I asked some very meaningful questions and plotted graphs and other visualization entities to get insights from data.  I implemented 4 machine learning algorithms logistic classifier, Random Forest, XGboost and naive bayes classifier. I did hyperparameter tuning to improve our model performance.
